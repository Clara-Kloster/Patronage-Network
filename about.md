This site presents data from the ['Script and Text in Time and Space'](https://nors.ku.dk/english/research/projects/script-and-text-in-space-and-time/) research project at the University of Copenhagen and funded by the [Velux Foundation](https://veluxfoundations.dk/da/content/34-mio-kr-til-humanvidenskabelig-forskning). The project focuses on the charter collection of the monastery of St. Clare in Roskilde. Now kept in the Arnamagn√¶an Collection at the University of Copenhagen, this is the best-preserved archive from any medieval Danish monastery, and contains hundreds of original documents written in Latin and Danish. 

The St. Clare charter collection is now comprised of two broad categories of charters: those that originally belonged in the monastic archive and those that were later added to its collection for various reasons. The overlap of people named in the two sets of charters may help us explain why the charters from the second category were grouped together with the monastic archive.

The [Network 1](/network_1/) page visualizes the connections between every person named in every charter studied by the 'Script and Text' team. The individuals identified in the charters are represented by dots. If two people are named in one or more of the same documents, they are connected by a line.
